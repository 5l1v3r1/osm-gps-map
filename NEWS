Changes in 0.4.0
  * Map can now be constructed by passing a MAP_SOURCE ID instead of
    the map repo uri
  * Fix iter safety when purging the tile cache
  * Fix for segfault when adding images to the map
  * Remove map repo uris from public API. They should now be retrieved using
    osm_gps_map_source_get_repo_uri(OsmGpsMapSource_t source)
  * Add osm_gps_map_get_scale
  * Implement a blank map source that just draws grey tiles

Changes in 0.3.0
======================
  * A new major contributor, Alberto Mardegan, 
    worked on many of the new features of this release. Thanks a lot Alberto!
  * Draw map tracks with Cairo by default.
  * Interpolate between zoom levels while waiting for a tile to download.
  * Stop using GET_PRIVATE, and cache priv* for performance.
  * Keep an extra border of images offscreen for smoother scrolling at 
    the edges of the map.

    (previously they were loaded from disk)
  * Add some new api; osm_gps_set_center, osm_gps_map_scroll.
